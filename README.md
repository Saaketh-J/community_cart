# CommunityCart

## About
The purpose of CommunityCart is to bring the community together by connecting users who live in the same area to collaborate on groceries pick-ups. During the Covid-19 pandamic, it is important that we isolate as much as possible and avoid crowding essential businesses. CommunityCart provides the community with the opportunity to help each other pick-up groceries and drop-off at their residences. 

How are we different from Uber, Postmates, InstaCart, and other food pickup services? We encourage the community to connect and help eachother on a vonlunteer basis. It's not about profit, it's about building a strong community.

Technologies used: FireBase, Flutter
